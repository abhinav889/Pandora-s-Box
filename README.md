## Secure Electronic Voting using Azure Blockchain

### Idea
Create a **WebApp** that is _Safe_ and works with _Limited Internet Connectivity_ to help people facing issues in voting.

### What We Plan To Build
We plan to build an _App_ that would help people to vote easily through their _Personal Devices_ rather than the conventional means like _Post_ which is not popular now.

### Feasibility
It can be implemented for the Whole Country, like the way it was done for _BitCoin_ Globally using **_BLOCKCHAIN_**.

### What Issues Would It Address
* Reduce Government Funds that were for allocating Voting Booths in _Sparsely Populated_ areas.
* Help _Disabled_, _Old_ and the _Sick_ to vote conveniently from their Premises.
* Would reduce any speculations of the _Votes_ being compromised as _BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY_ is highly secure.
* Would make it safer for people to vote in _Naxal Affected Areas_ during Elections.  


### Technologies Used
* #### FRONTEND: HTML,CSS and JAVASCRIPT
* #### BACKEND: Node.JS or PHP
